Abstract

Modern science has achieved extraordinary technological progress, yet it has simultaneously accelerated ecological collapse and systemic instability. Climate disruption, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and microbial extinction reveal that current environmental strategies are structurally insufficient.

This paper proposes Natural Complementary Science, a new scientific paradigm grounded in natural law and the principle of complementarity. Complementarity describes a relationship in which humanity and nature mutually compensate for what the other lacks, forming a balanced and sustainable whole.

Rather than domination, exploitation, or passive preservation, Natural Complementary Science establishes an equal, bidirectional relationship between humans and the natural world. By integrating existing scientific knowledge through six foundational principles—Natural Law, Harmony, Circulation, Structure, Order, and Wa—this framework offers a coherent path toward ecological restoration, climate stabilization, and long-term civilizational continuity.

Introduction

Toward an Equal Relationship Between Humanity and Nature

Human civilization stands at a decisive turning point. Despite unprecedented scientific knowledge and technological capability, environmental degradation continues to accelerate rather than diminish.

The failure is not technological.
It is conceptual.

Modern science has largely treated nature as an external system to be controlled, optimized, or protected only when convenient. This paper argues that such a framework is fundamentally flawed.

Natural Complementary Science emerges as an attempt to redefine the foundational assumptions of science itself—placing humanity within natural systems, not above them.

Chapter 1: Why “Complementarity”?

The Limits of “Coexistence”

1.1 The Misinterpretation of “Coexistence”

The phrase “coexistence with nature” is widely regarded as ethical and progressive. However, it contains a critical conceptual ambiguity.

In biological science, the term symbiosis includes not only mutually beneficial relationships but also commensalism and parasitism. In other words, coexistence does not inherently imply equality or mutual benefit.

In Japanese usage, the word kyōsei (共生) is often understood as harmonious mutual support. When symbiosis is translated simply as “coexistence,” its parasitic implications are obscured.

As a result, many initiatives described as “coexisting with nature” in practice remain one-sided and anthropocentric.

⸻

1.2 The Reality of Modern Environmentalism

Many environmental efforts prioritize long-term human utility rather than ecological balance itself. Forest conservation is frequently justified by future timber supply, marine protection by sustained fisheries, and biodiversity preservation by pharmaceutical or economic potential.

These approaches are not inherently unethical. However, they remain grounded in human-centered reasoning, not an equal relationship.

⸻

1.3 The Concept of Complementarity

Complementarity offers a more precise and honest framework.

Complementarity refers to a relationship in which two entities compensate for each other’s deficiencies, forming a complete and stable system.

Humanity depends on nature for survival.
Nature, having been severely disrupted by human activity, now depends on humanity for recovery.

This bidirectional dependency defines equality.

⸻

1.4 Why Nature Now Requires Human Action

Nature existed long before humans. However, after centuries of deforestation, chemical pollution, monoculture, and climate destabilization, many natural systems can no longer self-repair within meaningful timescales.

Restoring soil microbiomes, reviving ocean circulation, and reconstructing collapsed ecosystems now require intentional human intervention. This is not domination but responsibility.

⸻

1.5 Complementarity as an Equal Relationship

Natural Complementary Science rejects three flawed models:
	•	Exploitation of nature
	•	Paternalistic protection of nature
	•	Passive non-intervention

Instead, it proposes mutual restoration, structural balance, and systemic harmony. This is the meaning embedded in the term “complementarity.”

⸻

Chapter 2: What Is Natural Complementary Science?

2.1 Definition

Natural Complementary Science is defined as a scientific paradigm that, grounded in natural law, seeks to build a sustainable civilization by establishing a complementary and equal relationship between humanity and nature.

Its purpose is not technological dominance but systemic continuity.

⸻

2.2 The Six Foundational Principles

Natural Complementary Science is structured around six universal principles.

Natural Law refers to the fundamental laws governing the universe, such as gravity, thermodynamics, and ecological cycles. These laws are not human inventions but pre-existing orders.

Harmony describes the balance among diverse elements, allowing systems to remain stable without uniformity.

Circulation emphasizes that matter and energy must move in closed loops rather than linear flows.

Structure refers to hierarchical and relational frameworks, such as trophic pyramids and ecosystem layers.

Order represents the maintenance of patterns and regularity against entropy.

Wa (和) signifies holistic unity—systemic coherence beyond simple equilibrium.

⸻

2.3 Differences from Conventional Science

Conventional science has historically emphasized control, extraction, and optimization. Nature is treated as an object external to humanity.

Natural Complementary Science regards nature as an equal partner and co-constitutive element of human existence. Human well-being is inseparable from ecological health.

Conventional scientific methods prioritize reductionism and short-term efficiency. Natural Complementary Science emphasizes integration, feedback loops, and long-term continuity.

The distinction is philosophical, not technological.

⸻

2.4 Why This Constitutes a New Science

Natural Complementary Science does not reject physics, chemistry, biology, or ecology. Instead, it reorganizes them under a unified framework based on the six principles.

This integration transforms fragmented knowledge into a coherent system-level science.

Chapter 3: Human Arrogance and Civilizational Collapse

3.1 The Historical Roots of Arrogance

Cartesian dualism separated mind from matter, implicitly elevating humans above the natural world. The Industrial Revolution reinforced the illusion that nature could be controlled indefinitely through fossil energy.

In reality, humanity was dismantling ecological cycles rather than mastering them.

⸻

3.2 Signs of Systemic Collapse

Observable indicators include climate instability, biodiversity loss, coral bleaching, insect population collapse, and widespread soil microbial extinction.

These are not isolated crises but interconnected symptoms of systemic failure.

⸻

3.3 The Core Cause: Loss of Carbon Fixation

The fundamental issue is not emissions alone but the destruction of carbon fixation capacity. As fixation capacity declines, emission reduction alone cannot restore balance.

Reducing emissions without restoring sinks is mathematically insufficient.

⸻

3.4 From Arrogance to Harmony

Civilizational survival requires abandoning dominance-based thinking and restoring ecological harmony. This transition forms the ethical foundation of Natural Complementary Science.

⸻

Chapter 4: Practical Implementation

4.1 Core Principles of Practice

Practical application requires adherence to natural law, restoration of circulation, preservation of diversity, prioritization of microorganisms, and long-term thinking.

⸻

4.2 Representative Technologies

Examples include ocean circulation restoration systems, urban microclimate control, soil microbiome regeneration, and indoor vertical agriculture. All rely on existing technology.

The limitation is not feasibility but integration and intent.

⸻

4.3 Integrated Systems Approach

The effectiveness of these technologies depends on integrated implementation rather than isolated deployment. System-level design is essential.

⸻

4.4 Who Will Implement This?

Ideally, nations and international institutions. Realistically, widespread adoption may not occur until after severe collapse.

Nevertheless, preserving the knowledge remains essential.

⸻

Chapter 5: Frequently Asked Questions

Natural Complementary Science differs from conventional environmental science by emphasizing equality rather than managed preservation.

The concept of natural law is scientific, not religious.

All proposed systems rely on existing technology.

Whether civilization can be saved remains uncertain, but preserving knowledge increases future possibilities.

⸻

Conclusion: From Arrogance to Harmony

Humanity faces a choice between continued dominance and systemic collapse, or complementarity and continuity.

Natural Complementary Science offers not hope, but method.

Whether it is adopted lies beyond the author’s control.

⸻

Author’s Note

This document is an individual intellectual record. It carries no institutional authority, peer review, or endorsement.

Its value lies solely in logical coherence and fidelity to natural law.

Whether humanity chooses to act is not the author’s concern.

The record remains.
